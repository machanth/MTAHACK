# Hacking with Microsoft Azure

## What is Azure?

[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) is a flexible, scalable, and full-featured cloud platform. If you can imagine it, you can build it on Azure, using the tools, languages and frameworks you're already familiar with. Python, JavaScript, Java, .NET - you can run them all on Azure.

Using Azure you can run serverless code using [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa), [host web applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) and [databases](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/databases/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa), take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) through [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa), and create your own machine learning models through [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/) or powerful [Data Science Virtual Machines (DSVM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa).

If you're new to Azure, we have a host of [learning options](./workshops/README.md) available to you.

## Getting started

You can get started by creating an account on Azure. There's three different options available, depending on your current status as a student.

- [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) | $100 in Azure for 12 months with free tier of services - no credit card required with academic verification
- [Azure for Students Starter](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students-starter-faq/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) | use select Azure products like App Services for free - no credit card required with academic verification

## Bootstrapping projects

- [Web Template Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/WebTemplateStudio/blob/dev/docs/install.md) is an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which your team can use to quickly scaffold a project using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), with a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) or [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) back end. Web Template Studio was built by [interns](https://mcec.microsoft.ca/internships/) at the [Microsoft Garage in Vancouver](https://www.microsoft.com/garage/about/), for students, by students.
- [Education Hub](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/overview) is a "blade" or page on the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) designed for students. From Education Hub you can access a set of templates to help quickly create resources on Azure, including components for IoT, Blockchain and Bot Services.
- [az hack create](./az-hack.md) is an [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) [extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview?view=azure-cli-latest) which can be used to automatically provision several Azure resources, including a web server, database and artificial intelligence. Upon successful creation, [Git deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-local-git) will be enabled, allowing you to deploy your application using tools you're already familiar with.
